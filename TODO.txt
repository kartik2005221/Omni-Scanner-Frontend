TODO-6: Sanitize input before using in subprocess.run
    Potential Security Risk with subprocess.run:
    Using subprocess.run with user inputs directly can be a security risk (command injection). It is better to sanitize
    and validate inputs before using them in subprocess calls.
    For example, if the user input is used directly in the command, an attacker can inject additional commands
TODO-8: add csv and moving them to back up functionality on next run
todo-9: adding extra functionalities like,
    scapy>=2.5.0          # For ARP scanning and packet manipulation
    python-nmap>=0.7.1    # Nmap integration (requires nmap installed)
    prettytable>=3.6.0    # Clean terminal output formatting
    colorama>=0.4.6       # Cross-platform colored terminal text
    tqdm>=4.64.1          # Progress bars for long scans
    manuf>=1.1.5          # MAC address vendor lookup
todo-11: handling keyboard interrupt in all parts of script properly
todo-13: make a custom made script for different operating systems, and check for required packages and install them

Extra functionalities:
- make a script for all operating systems and check for required packages at first run and install them
- arguments vs. interactive mode, which mode to use, or both
    - should I make gui for this?
- add a section in readme for preparing user's os to run this script**
- update documentation**
after doing **, pull to the main branch
- Note: Host seems down. If it is really up, but blocking our ping probes, try -Pn, give an option to the user.

--disable-arp-ping, -Pn, (-a) not with the script
-o-all, -oX, -oG
